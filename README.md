# 🧠 Next Word Prediction Using LSTM & Early Stopping DL project

## 🚀 Project Overview  
✨ Today, I built an exciting project called **Next-Word-Prediction-Using-LSTM-&-Early-Stopping**! This **Deep Learning NLP** project uses **Python** and its libraries to analyze and process text, perform **EDA**, apply **Feature Engineering**, and train advanced machine learning and deep learning models.  

📜 The project focuses on predicting the next word in a given sequence of words using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.  
The dataset for training is **Shakespeare’s "Hamlet"**, chosen for its complexity and richness. Additionally, we’ve built a **web application** using **Streamlit**, where users can input a sequence and receive the predicted next word.
